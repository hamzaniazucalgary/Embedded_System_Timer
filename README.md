Designed a countdown timer app to be displayed on the computer terminal using UART2. The app uses push buttons as input for the timer. One button increments the minutes, another button increments the seconds, and the thrid button pauses and resumes the timer. If the third button is held down for more than 3 seconds, it will reset the timer.
